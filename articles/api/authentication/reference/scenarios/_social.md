# Social



Use this endpoint to authenticate a user with a social provider. This endpoint will return a 302 redirect to the social provider specified in `connection`.

Social connections only support browser-based (passive) authentication because most social providers don't allow a username and password to be entered into applications that they don't own. Therefore, the user will be redirected to the provider's sign in page.
